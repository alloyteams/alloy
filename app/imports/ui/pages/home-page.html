                    Alloy is a UH student-built tool to help members of the
                    UH iLab and sPACE communities find projects and
                    find people for projects of their own. Have an idea for a
                    project that would look good on your resume? Want to do your
                    own custom senior project? Or do you just want experiment
                    and
                    learn something new with other students who just want to do
                    the same?
