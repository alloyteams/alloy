   A user document can contain any data you want to store about a user.
   Meteor treats the following fields specially:

   1. username: a unique String identifying the user.
   2. emails: an Array of Objects with keys address and verified; an email address
   may belong to at most one user. verified is a Boolean which is true if the user has
   verified the address with a token sent over email.
   3. createdAt: the Date at which the user document was created.
   4. profile: an Object which the user can create and update with any data. Do not store
   anything on profile that you wouldnâ€™t want the user to edit unless you have a deny
   rule on the Meteor.users collection.
   5. services: an Object containing data used by particular login services. For example,
   its reset field contains tokens used by forgot password links, and its resume field
   contains tokens used to keep you logged in between sessions.
